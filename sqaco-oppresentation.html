Name: Introduction
# A Bit About Myself

name: Before I started
# Thoughts Before Starting at FeneTech

- Believed I knew a decent amount about FeneVision

- Met several FeneTech Engineers and wanted to meet the rest of the team

- Hadn't had hands-on experience with SQL on a large database

- Wanted to explore the inner-workings of the FVEnigma

- Was excited to express my thoughts on improvements for FeneVision

- Wanted to fix annoying bugs and Quality of Life issues I found as a user at MWG

???
There was a lot more to learn

Everyone is really great, enjoyed the company culture

Class enviroments can only teach you so much about DB management

name: My Work
# My Work Thus Far

- Regression Testing
      - Gained exposure to areas of the system I did not work with during implementation
      - Updated test plans to reflect the current functionality and check cases that caused issues in the past
- Issue Reporting
.left[![Issues](issues.png)]
- Issue Testing
      - Checking that fixes both solved the problem and didn't introduce any new ones.

- Customer Care
      - Worked on a live session with Sunrise Windows where I found and solved their issue
      - Created a custom hold policy for Comfort View Products 
???
Since I knew somewhat how the system worked already I could identify issues more readily

Left is the first issue I wrote up, Right is the biggest issue i wrote up

left #19898: Key conflict when adding a city with a comma

right #20114: Inventory maintenance doesn't show correct qty on PO for partially serialized

Wrote and closed about 40 tickets each

name: Expectations vs. Reality
# Expectations and Reality

- I saw just how customizeable the software could be through configuration and custom enhancements

- Enjoyed the improvement made since my work with 11.1

- Issues that I found getting fixed is very rewarding

- Helped me apply a more analytical approach to Testing and writing quality code

- Improved my interpersonal communication skills

???
Devs working directly with customers on improving things for their business case

No more Prod DBs !! CAD enhanced!! RB isn't ugly!!

QA work will help me improve my skills as a programmer

Used to be more afraid talking to employers/ professionally
